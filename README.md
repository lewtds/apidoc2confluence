Short script to convert [apidoc][1]'s JSON output to Confluence wiki markup. 
This is to support teams using apidoc and want to put out their documentation
onto a corporate wiki for peer review, etc.

File paths are all hardcoded in `index.js`. Please update it accordingly
before using.

The code is in public domain. I don't intend to provide support, just wanna
put it out there. Thank you for passing by.
